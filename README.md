# C++ Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository contains all my educational projects in C++, from the basics to advanced topics. The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey and to showcase organized projects that anyone can explore.

## Repository Goals
- Improve my skills in C++ and gain a comprehensive understanding of programming.
- Build small and gradually more complex projects that demonstrate understanding of fundamental and advanced concepts.
- Organize projects professionally so they can serve as a reference for learning or be presented to HR.

## Repository Structure
- **chapter0_getting_started**: Setting up the development environment, writing and running the first program.
- **chapter1_basics**: Variables, operators, conditional statements, loops.
- **chapter2_functions**: Functions, parameters, file management, and organization using namespaces.
- **chapter3_debugging**: Practical examples of debugging programs.
- **Upcoming chapters**: Will contain more advanced projects such as objects, arrays, pointers, object-oriented programming (OOP), and more.

## How to Use
- Each chapter contains **separate folders for each project**.
- Each project contains a `main.cpp` file and possibly a small README explaining the project’s goal and usage.
- You can open any project, compile the code, and run it directly.

## Notes
- This repository documents my learning journey and will be updated continuously as I advance in C++.
